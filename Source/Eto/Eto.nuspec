    	Eto.Forms is a cross platform desktop user interface framework.
    	
    	This framework is built so that you can target multiple platforms with one UI codebase.

		The overall goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build functional applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit. This will make your applications look and work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

		For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.

		This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.
		
		In order to run your Eto.Forms based application, you must also install one (or all) of the following packages:
		
		- Eto.Platform.Wpf
		- Eto.Platform.Windows
		- Eto.Platform.Gtk
		- Eto.Platform.Mac
		- Eto.Platform.XamMac  * requires Xamarin Studio on OS X.
