Welcome to your first Eto.Forms cross-platform application!

This framework is built so that you can target multiple platforms with one UI codebase.

The overall goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build
functional applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit. This will
make your applications look and work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping
your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a
custom implementations per platform.

This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across
Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.

This sample application includes a MyEtoApplication.Main(), so delete the existing
Program.cs to use this as your program startup automatically.
